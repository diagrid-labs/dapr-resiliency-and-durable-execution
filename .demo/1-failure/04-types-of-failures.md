# Types of failures

## Transient failures

Transient failures are temporary and usually resolve themselves without human intervention.

- Retry policies are useful to handle transient failures.

## Permanent failures

Permanent failures are the opposite of transient failures and they do require human intervention to be resolved.

- Circuit breakers are useful to handle permanent failures.
